# Contribution guidelines

## Before you start

In order to help us process your contributions, please make sure you do the following:

- submit PR to the `dev` branch of the main repo. PRs submitted to other branches will be declined.
- let us know what's in the PR: sometimes code is not enough and in order to help us understand your awesome work please follow the PR template to provide required information.
- don't surprise us with big PR's. Instead create an issue & start a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount of time.
