## ‚≠ê Capabilities

The extension provides the following capabilities:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Welcome experience

The extension automatically detects if you have a SharePoint Framework project opened. If not, it will start with a welcome experience that will guide you through the process of creating a new project and validating your local environment.

![Welcome experience](./assets/images/welcome-experience.png)

Directly from this view, you may create a new project from scratch or from an existing web part, extension or ACE sample, or ACE scenario.

It is also possible to open an already existing project using Open folder button.

Last but not least it is possible to check your local workspace for the needed global dependencies to develop the SPFx solutions, like the correct Node version, gulp, yeoman etc., and install them if needed with a single click.

When running the extension for the first time it will present you a walkthrough that will give you a step-by-step guide to get started with SharePoint Framework development and will go over the main functionalities of SharePoint Framework (SPFx) Toolkit.

![Walkthrough](./assets/images/walkthrough.png)

[Check out our docs for more details](https://github.com/pnp/vscode-viva/wiki/4-Welcome-experience)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set up your development environment

To ensure that you can develop SPFx solutions, you may use the **check dependencies** functionality. 

![Validate dependency](./assets/images/validate-dependency.png)

This action will check if you have the required dependencies such as:

- Node version: 18
- NPM dependencies:
  - gulp
  - yo
  - @microsoft/generator-sharepoint

In case you do not have all dependencies installed, or some are incorrect version, you can use the **install dependencies** action to install them.

>  [!NOTE]
>  The list of valid dependencies is based on [set up your development environment recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment)

[Check out our docs for more details](https://github.com/pnp/vscode-viva/wiki/5.1-Validate-and-set-up-a-local-workspace)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Don't Start from scratch. Reuse an SPFx web part or extension or ACE sample

You may kick-start your development with a new project based on an existing ACE or SPFx web part or extension with a click of a button. All of the provided samples are powered by [PnP Samples repositories](https://pnp.github.io/sp-dev-fx-webparts/samples/type/).

![Sample gallery](./assets/images/samples.png)

The extension provides a set of filters to help you find the right sample for your needs. You may search by: author, title, description, SPFx version, and component type. It is also possible browse sample details view directly from VS Code checking all sample details before you create a new project.

Switch between the list and grid view and don't worry about the size of your VS Code as it is fully responsive.

![Sample gallery is responsive](./assets/images/samples-responsive.png)

Check out how easy it is to create a new project based on a existing sample üëá. 
![Create project based on web part sample](./assets/images/sample-gallery.gif)

[Check out our docs for more details](https://github.com/pnp/vscode-viva/wiki/5.2-Scaffolding#2-dont-start-from-scratch---sample-galleries)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start from an ACE scenario

Start your solution based on the provided set of ACE scenarios with ready-to-use code to showcase what's possible. Scenarios are provided with detailed guidance using the [Code Tour](https://aka.ms/codetour) to provide you with more details on the structure and options.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Create a new project

Creating a new project was never easier. Just use the **create a new project** action, and the extension will guide you through the process with a dedicated scaffolding form.

![Create new project](./assets/images/scaffolding.png)

Check it out in action üëá.

![Create new project](./assets/images/scaffolding-form.gif)

It's possible to scaffold any kind of SPFx project.

![All SPFx project support](./assets/images/scaffolding-support.png)

Install additional dependencies with a single click straight from the scaffolding form. Currently we support installing [PnP reusable property pane controls](https://pnp.github.io/sp-dev-fx-property-controls/), [PnP reusable React controls](https://pnp.github.io/sp-dev-fx-controls-react/), and [PnPjs](https://pnp.github.io/pnpjs/).

![Additional dependency step](./assets/images/scaffolding-additional-step.png)

When you can set the additional dependencies it's also possible to automatically create the node version manager file with the version of Node.js used when creating the project. These settings are available in the extension settings.

![Additional dependency step node version](./assets/images/scaffolding-additional-step-node-version.png)

[Check out our docs for more details](https://github.com/pnp/vscode-viva/wiki/5.2-Scaffolding#1-scaffold-a-new-spfx-project)

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Sign in to your tenant & retrieve environment details

The extension allows you to sign in to your Microsoft 365 tenant using CLI for Microsoft 365.

![login](./assets/images/login.png)

SPFx Toolkit needs and Entra App Registration to be able to sign in to your tenant. You may either use an existing app registration or create a new one with a single click using a dedicated form. 

![sign in options](./assets/images/sign-in-options.png)

SPFx Toolkit will guide you through the process of creating a new app registration either manually by providing step-by-step guidance or automatically by creating the app registration for you.

![entra app reg form](./assets/images/sign-in-entra-app-reg-form.png)

![app registration](./assets/images/sign-in.gif)

If you already have an Entra App Registration you may use it to sign in to your tenant by providing the Client Id and Tenant Id.

![app registration](./assets/images/sign-in-existing-app.gif)

Thanks to that the extension will retrieve helpful URLs from your tenant like link to: 

- SharePoint main site 
- SharePoint admin site
- SharePoint web API permission management page

Additionally, the extension will check and retrieve tenant service health incidents that are currently happening in your tenant so that you gain quick insights on your tenant health.

![tenant details](./assets/images/tenant-links.png)

After successful sign in an additional view is presented that shows list links to app catalogs available in the tenant, both tenant-level and all site-level app catalogs. Additionally it will show you all tenant-wide extensions installed on your tenant with.

![tenant details](./assets/images/app-catalog-list.png)

Using the extension settings you may choose show or hide the tenant-wide extensions list and tenant health incidents list.

![settings](./assets/images/settings.png)

Sign-in is also required for some actions to work properly like the deploy action which allows you to upload of the .sppkg file to the tenant or site-level App Catalog.

[Check out our docs for more details](https://github.com/pnp/vscode-viva/wiki/5.3-Login-to-your-tenant-&-retrieve-environment-details)

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Gulp tasks

The extension shows all possible Gulp tasks one may run on an SPFx project. The tasks allow you to clean, bundle, package, serve the project with a single click.

![Gulp Tasks](./assets/images/tasks.png)

[Check out our docs for more details](https://github.com/pnp/vscode-viva/wiki/5.4-Gulp-tasks)

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Actions

The actions section allows unique functionalities that may significantly boost productivity when working with SPFx projects.

![Actions](./assets/images/actions.png)

Currently the extension allows you to:

- **CI/CD Workflow** - This action will allow you to generate yaml CI/CD GitHub Workflow or Azure DevOps Pipeline to bundle, package, and deploy your project to any app catalog on every code push. 

![CI CD pipeline](./assets/images/CICD-pipeline.png)

![Rename](./assets/images/rename.png)

[Check out our docs for more details](https://github.com/pnp/vscode-viva/wiki/5.5-Actions#rename-current-project)

- **Grant API permissions** - The action will Grant all API permissions specified in the package-solution.json of the current project. This is especially helpful if you just want to debug your SPFx solution using Workbench. No longer do you need to bundle, package, and deploy the project to then go to the SharePoint admin portal and consent to the permissions. All of that is now done with just a single click. 

![Grant permissions](./assets/images/grant-permissions.png)

[Check out our docs for more details](https://github.com/pnp/vscode-viva/wiki/5.5-Actions#grant-api-permissions)

- **Deploy project** - This action will only work when the user is logged in to tenant and the sppkg file is present. The action will deploy the project to the selected (tenant or site) app catalog. 

![Deploy](./assets/images/deploy.png)

[Check out our docs for more details](https://github.com/pnp/vscode-viva/wiki/5.5-Actions#grant-api-permissions)

- **Add new component** - Allows scaffolding a new SPFx project as a new component of the currently opened project. The action under the hood uses the same SharePoint Yeoman generator to scaffold a new project and this feature is an abstraction UI layer. 

![Add component](./assets/images/add-component.png)

[Check out our docs for more details](https://github.com/pnp/vscode-viva/wiki/5.5-Actions#add-new-component)

- **Open sample/scenario galleries of the SPFx web part, extensions, or ACEs projects** - SharePoint Framework Toolkit supports a couple of sample galleries that may be used to scaffold a new SPFx project.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Teams Toolkit Integration

[Teams Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) is a widely used VS Code extension that aims to help you develop solutions that will allow you to extend Microsoft Teams. SharePoint Framework Toolkit aims to boost your productivity in SharePoint Framework solutions that may be used to extend SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Viva Connections, Outlook, and Microsoft365.com. Among many awesome functionalities, Teams Toolkit allows you to create a project to extend Teams Tab with SPFx project, and that‚Äôs where both of those extensions may cooperate.

![Teams Toolkit integration](./assets/images/better-together.png)

[Check out our docs for more details](https://github.com/pnp/vscode-viva/wiki/6-Teams-Toolkit-Integration)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Node.js Version Manager Support

By default, the SharePoint Framework Toolkit will use the Node.js version that is installed on your machine. If you want to use a different version, you can use a Node.js Version Manager such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [nvs](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs). The SharePoint Framework Toolkit will detect the preferred version of Node.js if a `.nvmrc` file is present in the root of your project, and will use that version for all the actions.

It's possible to use the settings to change which Node.js version manager you want to use. You may choose between `nvm` and `nvs`. If you wish to avoid using a Node.js version manager, you can set the value to `none`

![Settings Node version manager](./assets/images/settings-node-version-manager.png)

Other than selecting the Node.js version manager you may also select which file should be used to store the Node.js version. By default, the extension will use `.nvmrc` file, but you may change it to `.node-version` if you are using `nvs`.

![Settings Node version file](./assets/images/settings-node-version-manager-file.png)

It is also possible to set the default behavior when you're about to scaffold a new project. To do so there is a specific setting named `Create Node Version File Default Value`.

![Settings Node version file default value](./assets/images/settings-node-version-manager-file-default-value.png)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ SPFx Toolkit GitHub Chat Participant 

![SPFx Toolkit chat](./assets/images/chat-intro.png)

Now you may use SPFx Toolkit as a chat participant in GitHub Copilot chat extension. Simply, mention @spfx in the chat to ask dedicated questions regarding SharePoint Framework development. 

![SPFx Toolkit chat in action](./assets/images/chat-in-action.gif)

@spfx is your dedicated AI Copilot that will help you with anything that is needed to develop your SharePoint Framework project. It has predefined commands that are tailored toward a specific activity for which you require guidance.

![SPFx Toolkit chat commands](./assets/images/chat-commands.png)

Currently, we support the following commands:
- `/setup` - that is dedicated to providing information on how to setup your local workspace for SharePoint Framework development
- `/new` - that may be used to get guidance on how to create a new solution or find and reuse an existing sample from the PnP SPFx sample gallery
- `/code` - that is fine-tuned to provide help in coding your SharePoint Framework project and provides additional boosters like validating the correctness of your SPFx project, scaffolding a CI/CD workflow, or renaming your project, and many more.
