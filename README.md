# Viva Connections Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

With the Viva Connections Toolkit extension, you can create and manage your Viva Connections solutions in your tenant. All actions you need to perform during the development flow are at your fingertips.

![Sample Gallery](./assets/images/sample-gallery.png)

## Architecture

Viva Connections Toolkit for Viva Studio Code is an abstraction layer on top of the [SPFx](https://aka.ms/spfx) Yeoman generator and [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/). All operations and actions are performed on the command line level using these two tools with the environment settings on your computer.

This means that the features and capabilities provided through this tool are available for any solution which has been build with SPFx.
 
## Capabilities

The extension provides the following capabilities:

### Welcome experience

The extension automatically detects if you are in a SharePoint Framework project. If not, it will show helpful actions to allow you to create a new Viva Connections app.

### Check the dependencies

To ensure that you can create Viva Connections Toolkit, you can use the **check dependencies** functionality. This action will check if you have the required dependencies to create a new Viva Connections app.

- Node version: 16
- NPM dependencies:
  - gulp
  - yo
  - @microsoft/generator-sharepoint

> **Info**: This list is based on the [set up your development environment recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment)

### Installing the dependencies

In case when you do not have all dependencies installed, you can use the **install dependencies** action to install them.

### Start from a sample

From our sample gallery, you can quickly get started with one of the Viva Connections Toolkit that were created by the community.

### Start from a scenario

Start your solution creation based on the provided set of scenarios with ready to use code to showcase what's possible. Scenario solutions are provided with detailed guidance using the [Code Tour](https://aka.ms/codetour) to provide you more details on the structure and options.

### Create a new project

Creating a new project was never easier. Just use the **create a Viva Connections project** action, and the extension will guide you through the process.

### Project actions

When you open a SharePoint Framework solution, you will be able to Sign in and out to your tenant. This allows you to retrieve helpful links to your tenant main SharePoint site and app catalog.

You may also run any gulp task with a click of a button
