## Capabilities

The extension provides the following capabilities:

### Check the dependencies

To ensure that you can create Viva Connections Toolkit, you can use the **check dependencies** functionality. This action will check if you have the required dependencies to create a new hosted app.

- Node version: 12 or 14
- NPM dependencies:
  - gulp
  - yo
  - @microsoft/generator-sharepoint

### Installing the dependencies

In case when you do not have all dependencies installed, you can use the **install dependencies** action to install them.

### Start from a sample

From our sample gallery, you can quickly get started with one of the Viva Connections Toolkit that were created by the community.

### Create a new project

Creating a new project was never easier. Just use the **create a Viva Connections project** action, and the extension will guide you through the process.

### Project actions

When you open an M365 Hosted App project, you will be able to perform the following actions:

- Sign in and out to your tenant
- Run gulp tasks
- Upgrade the solution
- Deploy the solution
- Project validation
- Useful links to help you get started
