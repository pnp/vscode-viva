## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

Viva Connections Toolkit for Visual Studio Code is an abstraction layer on top of the [SPFx](https://aka.ms/spfx) Yeoman generator and [CLI for Microsoft 365](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/). All operations and actions are performed on the command line level using these two tools with the environment settings on your computer.

This means that the features and capabilities provided through this tool are available for any solution which has been built with SPFx.
 
## ‚≠ê Capabilities

The extension provides the following capabilities:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Welcome experience

The extension automatically detects if you are in a SharePoint Framework project. If not, it will show helpful actions to allow you to create a new SPFx or ACE solution.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Check the dependencies

- NPM dependencies:
  - gulp
  - yo
  - @microsoft/generator-sharepoint

> **Info**: This list is based on the [set up your development environment recommendations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Installing the dependencies

In case when you do not have all dependencies installed, you can use the **install dependencies** action to install them.
