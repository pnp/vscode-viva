            <p>
                Working with SPFx takes effort. You need to set up the right development environment, install the correct versions of Node.js and global tools, scaffold projects, run the right build and package commands, deploy packages, approve API permissions, and manage your solutions across different app catalogs. Most of this means memorizing steps and constantly switching between VS Code, the terminal, and various SharePoint portals.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's why we built SPFx Toolkit, an open-source extension co-created with the Microsoft 365 developer community, to bring the full SPFx development lifecycle into a single, centralized experience inside VS Code.
