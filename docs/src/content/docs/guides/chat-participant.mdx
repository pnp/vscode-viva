## `/manage` 

This command is beta and will allow you to ask and retrieve any kind of data from you SharePoint Online tenant. This command will only work if your are signed in to your tenant. It uses CLI for Microsoft 365 commands under the hood to retrieve and explain data and assets from your SharePoint Online tenant. Currently, it does support only retrieving information, it will not support you in creating, updating or removing any resources. For example, you want to check if some list item or file exists. Or how many items with specific metadata do you have on a list? Or ask for content type columns to generate an interface based on the response quickly.
