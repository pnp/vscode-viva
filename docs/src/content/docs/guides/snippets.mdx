The SharePoint Framework Toolkit comes together as a bundle with two other extensions. One of them is [SPFx Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eliostruyf.spfx-snippets) created by [Elit Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/). 

It contains snippets for working in:

- JavaScript (resource files)
- React
- SASS (SCSS)
- TypeScript
- JSON

In order to start using it simply start typing from `spfx-` and you should see a full list of snippets that will inject code into the current file.
