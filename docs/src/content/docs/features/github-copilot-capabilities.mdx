## Agent Mode - Language Model Tools

You don't need to do anything specific to use any of the language model tools in GitHub Copilot agent mode. Copilot should figure out the best tool that it may use to fulfill your prompt. Optionally you may `#` hashtag a tool in your prompt to make it clear what you want to be used.

### `/info` 

This command will allow you to ask and retrieve any kind of data from your SharePoint Online tenant. This command will only work if you are signed in to your tenant. It uses CLI for Microsoft 365 commands under the hood to retrieve and explain data from your SharePoint Online tenant. Currently, it does support only retrieving information, it will not support you in creating, updating or removing any resources for this you should be using Language Model tools in agent mode. 

For example, you may check if some list item or file exists. Or how many items with specific metadata do you have on a list? Or ask for content type columns to generate an interface based on the response quickly.
