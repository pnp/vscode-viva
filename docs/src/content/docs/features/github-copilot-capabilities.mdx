SPFx Toolkit provides a set of AI capabilities that may be used in GitHub Copilot Chat extension. The chat participant allows you to have a discussion grounded for SharePoint Framework development and the Language Model tools will provide you with several capabilities to manage your SharePoint Online tenant.

## Agent Mode - Language Model Tools

SPFx Toolkit provides a set of language model tools that are available in GitHub Copilot agent mode. Some of them are designed to work in the context of your SharePoint Framework project but other may work regardless of what you have opened in VS Code and aim to do common task on your SharePoint Online tenant.

You don't need to do anything specific to use any of the language model tools in GitHub Copilot agent mode. Copilot should figure out the best tool that it may use to fulfill your prompt. Optionally you may `#` hashtag a tool in your prompt to make it clear what you want to be used.

### `/info (Deprecated)`

The `/info` command has been deprecated. For tenant data retrieval, list and file discovery, metadata queries, schema extraction, and read-only introspection capabilities, please use the **[CLI for Microsoft 365 MCP server](https://pnp.github.io/cli-microsoft365/user-guide/using-cli-mcp-server/)** directly. It is now the main supported way to access and inspect SharePoint Online tenant data.
