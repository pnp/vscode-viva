The VS Code extension allows you to validate if your local workspace meets the needed requirements in order to develop an SPFx project. If some requirement is not met then it is possible to install them using the `install` button. The extension checks for the correct Node version and if `gulp-cli`, `yo`, `@microsoft/generator-sharepoint` are installed as well.
