SPFx Toolkit comes with a set of features that will speed up your development process. It includes tasks view with all of the available Gulp tasks with also some new once added by this extension that are a combination of existing tasks. The extension also comes with a set of code snippets that will help you to quickly scaffold new code in your SPFx project.

## Gulp Tasks view

One of the sections of the extension shows all possible Gulp tasks one may run on an SPFx project. The tasks allow you to `clean`, `bundle`, `package`, `serve` and many more with a single click.

- **Deploy project assets to Azure Storage**: Uploads project assets to Azure Storage.
- **Package**: Packages the project into a deployable solution.
- **Publish**: Bundles and packages the project for deployment.
- **Serve**: Starts a local development server to preview the project.
- **Test**: Runs the project's test cases.
- **Trust self-signed developer certificate**: Trusts the self-signed certificate required for local development.

## Coding Snippets 

The SharePoint Framework Toolkit comes together as a bundle with two other extensions. One of them is [SPFx Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eliostruyf.spfx-snippets) created by [Elio Struyf](https://www.eliostruyf.com/). 

It contains snippets for working in:

- JavaScript (resource files)
- React
- SASS (SCSS)
- TypeScript
- JSON

In order to start using it simply start typing from `spfx-` and you should see a full list of snippets that will inject code into the current file.
