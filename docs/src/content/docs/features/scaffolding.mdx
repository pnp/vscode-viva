title: Create a New SPFx Project
description: Learn how to scaffold a new SharePoint Framework (SPFx) project using the SharePoint Framework Toolkit. Choose between a guided form or community-driven sample gallery.
---

## Overview

The SPFx Toolkit provides two main ways to create SPFx projects:

1. **Scaffolding Form** - Create a project from scratch using a guided interface  
   *Use this option when you want full control over your project structure, component types, and configuration. Ideal for new solutions or when you need a clean starting point as per your requirements.*

2. **Sample Gallery** - Start with a sample from the community  
   *Use this option when you want to speed up development by starting from a sample, or learn from working examples. Ideal for rapid prototyping, learning, or when you need a solution similar to an existing sample.*

## Scaffolding Form (Create from Scratch)

Use a form-based UI to scaffold a new SPFx project without manually running the Yeoman generator.

### Getting Started

You can create a new SPFx project in two ways:

**Option 1: From the Welcome View**
1. Click **"Create a new project"** in the SPFx Toolkit welcome view (visible when no SPFx project is open).

**Option 2: From the Command Palette**
1. **Open the Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`).
2. Run `SPFx Toolkit: Create new project`.

Both options will launch a webview that guides you through the project setup process.

### Step 1: General Information

#### For New Projects:
1. **Select Parent Folder**
   - Click the "Folder" button to browse and select where your project will be created.
   - The selected path will appear in the text field.

2. **Enter Solution Name**
   - Provide a unique name for your SPFx solution.
   - The toolkit will validate that the name doesn't already exist in the selected folder.

3. **Choose Component Type**
   - Select from available component types:
     - **Web Part** - SharePoint Framework (SPFx) client-side web parts are built with modern tools and frameworks, and can be deployed to modern and classic SharePoint pages. They are the building blocks of pages that appear on a SharePoint site. They also enable extending Microsoft Teams tabs, providing powerful ways to enhance both SharePoint and Teams.
     - **Extension** - SharePoint Framework (SPFx) Extensions let you enhance SharePoint user experience by customizing toolbars, list views, forms, and notifications. They work with frameworks like React and Angular, and include four main types: Application Customizers, Field Customizers, Command Sets, and Form Customizers.
     - **Adaptive Card Extension** - ACEs are the primary way to extend Viva Connections and SharePoint. They use the Adaptive Card Framework with a JSON schema to create a unified UI, managed by Microsoft, allowing you to focus on business logic.
     - **Library** - SharePoint Framework (SPFx) library is a component that allows you to create and share reusable code across multiple components within a tenant, providing a way to manage and reference common functionality.

#### For Adding Components to Existing Projects:
- Component type selection (same options as above).
- The folder path and solution name are automatically detected.

### Step 2: Component Details

1. **Component Name**
   - Enter a unique name for your component.
   - For existing projects, the toolkit validates the name doesn't conflict with existing components.

2. **Framework Selection** (Web Parts only)
   - **No framework** - Use any library or write pure JavaScript for maximum flexibility.
   - **React** - Popular library for building dynamic and responsive UI components.
   - **Minimal** - Lightweight setup with minimal dependencies for straightforward functionality.

3. **Extension Type** (Extensions only)
   - **Application Customizer** - Adds scripts to the page, and accesses well-known HTML element placeholders and extends them with custom renderings.
   - **Field Customizer** - Provides modified views to data for fields within a list.
   - **ListView Command Set** - Extends the SharePoint command surfaces to add new actions, and provides client-side code that you can use to implement behaviors.
   - **Form Customizer** - Provides a way to associate and override default new, edit and view form experience of list and libraries with custom forms by associating component to content type.
   - **Search Query Modifier** - Modifies search queries to enhance search results.

4. **Template Selection** (Adaptive Card Extensions only)
   - **Generic Card Template** - A flexible template that can be customized for various use cases, displaying general information and content in an adaptive card format.
   - **Search Query Modifier** - A template designed to modify and enhance search queries, improving the relevance and accuracy of search results displayed in adaptive cards.
   - **Data Visualization Card Template** - A template focused on presenting data visualizations, such as charts and graphs, within adaptive cards to provide clear and insightful data representations.

### Step 3: Additional Steps (New Projects Only)

Install core and optional dependencies to enhance your development experience:

#### Package Installation Options

- **Run npm install after creation** *(enabled by default)* - Installs dependencies after project creation.
- **Install [Reusable property pane controls](https://pnp.github.io/sp-dev-fx-property-controls/)** *(disabled by default)* - Installs reusable property pane controls for SharePoint Framework solutions.
- **Install [PnP Reusable React Controls](https://pnp.github.io/sp-dev-fx-controls-react/)** *(Web Parts only, disabled by default)* - Installs ready-to-use React components for SharePoint.
- **Install [PnPjs](https://pnp.github.io/pnpjs/) (`@pnp/sp`, `@pnp/graph`)** *(disabled by default)* - Installs a collection of fluent libraries for consuming SharePoint, Graph, and Office 365 REST APIs in a type-safe way.
- **Add React & ReactDOM** *(Application Customizers only, disabled by default)* - Adds React support for extension development.
- **Add [SPFx Fast Serve](https://github.com/s-KaiNet/spfx-fast-serve)** *(disabled by default)* - Configures solution for faster local builds and instant reload.
- **Create Node Version Manager Configuration File** *(disabled by default)* - Creates `.nvmrc` or `.node-version` based on your system configuration.

## Sample Gallery (Start with a sample)

Kickstart your project with examples from the Microsoft 365 & Power Platform community. The Sample Gallery provides access to real-world SPFx solutions that you can use as starting points for your own projects.

### Getting Started

You can open the sample gallery in three ways:

**Option 1: From the Welcome View**
1. Open the SharePoint Framework Toolkit welcome view (visible when no SPFx project is open).
2. Click **View samples** action.

**Option 2: From the Command Palette**
1. **Open the Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`).
2. Type `SPFx: Open SharePoint Framework Samples gallery` and select it.

**Option 3: From Existing Projects**
1. Navigate to the **Actions** section in the SPFx Toolkit sidebar.
2. Click **View samples** action.

All options will open the sample gallery in a new webview where you can browse and filter available samples.
