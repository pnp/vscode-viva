After successful sign in, an additional view is presented that shows a list of links to app catalogs available in the tenant, both tenant-level and all site-level app catalogs. You can expand each app catalog to reveal the list of apps contained within. Selecting an app navigates you to its details page. Additionally, hovering over an app node presents a set of actions, allowing you to perform various operations directly on the selected app.

- **Retract**: Reverses the deployment, preventing the solution from being installed in sites.
- **Remove**: Removes the app from the app catalog.
- **Enable**: Allows end users to add the solution to their SharePoint sites.
- **Disable**: Hides the solution from end users, preventing them from adding it to sites.
- **Upgrade**: Upgrades the solution to the latest version available in the app catalog for the specified site.
- **Install**: Install the solution from tenant or site collection app catalog to a site.
- **Uninstall**: Uninstall the solution from a site.
