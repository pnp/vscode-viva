## Welcome Experience

The extension automatically detects if your VS Code is opened in the context of SharePoint Framework project. If it is not, then SPFx Toolkit will present a welcome experience that will guide you through the process of setting up your local environment for SharePoint Framework development and creating your very first project.

Directly from this view, you may create a new project either from scratch or based on one of the available samples from the sample gallery. It is also possible to open an already existing project using Open folder button.

To ensure you are ready for SharePoint Framework development, the toolkit may check your local workspace for the needed global dependencies, like the correct Node version, gulp cli, or yeoman generator, and install them if needed with a single click.

## Walkthrough

When running the extension for the first time, it will open up a step-by-step walkthrough that will provide guidance on how to get started with SharePoint Framework development and will go over the main functionalities of SharePoint Framework (SPFx) Toolkit.
