## Better Together

[Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension) is a widely used VS Code extension that aims to help you develop solutions that will allow you to extend Microsoft Teams. SharePoint Framework Toolkit aims to boost your productivity in building SharePoint Framework solutions that may be used to extend SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Viva Connections, Outlook, and Microsoft365.com. Among many awesome functionalities, Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit allows you to create a project to extend Teams Tab with SPFx project, and thatâ€™s where both of those extensions may cooperate.

SharePoint Framework Toolkit understands Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit project and will execute all tasks and actions directly in the `src` folder, where the SPFx web part is created by Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit.

Also, SharePoint Framework Toolkit will check if an ACE component is present in your SPFx project and if so it will suggest installing [Microsoft Adaptive Card Previewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.vscode-adaptive-cards) to get additional support when creating ACE views.
