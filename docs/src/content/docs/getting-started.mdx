## 🔖 Release vs. Pre-release Versions

### Release Version

The **release version** of the SPFx Toolkit is the **stable** version that is ready for production use and is available in the VS Code marketplace for easy installation. This version is released through the **main branch** and is triggered by the **main release pipeline**. A new release is created for each **major** or **minor** version update, including detailed changelog updates, release blog post, documentation, and a `.vsix` package for distribution.

### Pre-release Version

The **pre-release version** of the SPFx Toolkit is for testing **beta features** that are still in development. This version is available through the **dev branch** and is triggered by the **pre-release pipeline**. Pre-releases allow users to try out the latest features before they are officially part of the next stable release.

Once a **pre-release version** is available, you will be able to switch between the **release** and **pre-release** versions directly in VS Code.
