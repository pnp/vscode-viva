title: Telemetry
---

The SPFx Toolkit collects basic usage telemetry to help us understand how the extension is used and improve its features. We follow the VS Code Telemetry extension authors guide and use the recommended `@vscode/extension-telemetry` package to send anonymized telemetry data to Azure Application Insights.

## What We Track

We collect anonymized usage data for the following actions:

### Actions View

- Deploy Project
- Set Form Customizer
- Scaffold CI/CD Workflow
- View Samples Gallery
- Use @spfx in GitHub Copilot
- Validate Local Setup
- Install Dependencies

### Tasks View

## Privacy and Data Protection

- All telemetry data is anonymized and does not contain personal information
- No code, file paths, or project-specific data is collected
- Data is used solely to understand feature usage and prioritize improvements
- We comply with relevant privacy regulations and Microsoft's privacy policies
- You can disable telemetry through VS Code's standard telemetry settings

## How to Disable Telemetry

To disable telemetry collection, you can use VS Code's built-in telemetry settings:
1. Open VS Code Settings (File > Preferences > Settings)
2. Search for "Telemetry"
3. Set "Telemetry: Telemetry Level" to "off"

This will disable telemetry for all VS Code extensions that respect the standard telemetry settings, including the SharePoint Framework Toolkit.
