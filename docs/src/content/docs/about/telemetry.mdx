title: Telemetry
---

As of now we do not collect any telemetry data from the extension that would be sent to any external service allowing us to understand how the extension is used. We are considering adding telemetry in the future to help us improve the extension and its features. If we do so, we will ensure that it is done in a way that respects user privacy and complies with relevant regulations.
Currently we only record the number of times the extension is installed and was it installed from the Marketplace website or the embedded VS Code Marketplace. This data is used to understand the popularity of the extension and to help us prioritize features and improvements.
