With .Net web.config file we would be able to update independently without the need of compiling DLLs. If that behavior is required, you can store your app settings in a SharePoint list and change them from there. However, that will have performance degradation over if the setting was part of the SPFx code where the logic can get a setting value in milliseconds.",
