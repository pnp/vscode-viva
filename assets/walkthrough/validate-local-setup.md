# Set up your SharePoint Framework development environment

To build and deploy client-side web parts, extensions, or adaptive cards using the SharePoint Framework, you will need to set up your development environment. SPFx requires:

- Node.js 
- Yeoman
- Gulp
- Yeoman SharePoint generator

If you have Node.js, you can validate and install these dependencies by running the following commands in your terminal.
    
```sh
npm install gulp-cli yo @microsoft/generator-sharepoint --global
```

or you can use SPFx toolkit to validate and install these dependencies for you.
