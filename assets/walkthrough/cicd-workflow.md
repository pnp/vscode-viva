SharePoint Framework Toolkit extends VS Code with additional UI to present you with a scaffolding form that will allow you to create a CI/CD Workflow in 3 easy steps.

It's important to know that many fields are already pre-filled and it is possible to hit create without changing any value to get a basic and default YAML workflow file.
