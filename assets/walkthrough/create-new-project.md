## Create a new project

Creating a new project was never easier. Just use the **create a new project** action, and the extension will guide you through the process with a dedicated scaffolding form.

It's possible to scaffold any kind of SPFx project.

Install additional dependencies with a single click straight from the scaffolding form. Currently we support installing [PnP reusable property pane controls](https://pnp.github.io/sp-dev-fx-property-controls/), [PnP reusable React controls](https://pnp.github.io/sp-dev-fx-controls-react/), and [PnPjs](https://pnp.github.io/pnpjs/).

## Don't Start from scratch. Reuse an SPFx (web part or extension) or ACE sample

You may kick-start your development with a new project based on an existing ACE or SPFx web part or extension with a click of a button. All of the provided samples are powered by [PnP Samples repositories](https://pnp.github.io/sp-dev-fx-webparts/samples/type/).

The extension provides a set of filters to help you find the right sample for your needs. You may search by: author, title, description, SPFx version, and component type. It is also possible browse sample details view directly from VS Code checking all sample details before you create a new project.

Switch between the list and grid view and don't worry about the size of your VS Code as it is fully responsive.
